Participant: participant number

Exposure: exposure group.
m = mirror (test condition: post-adaptation mirror exposure)
c = control (control condition: pre-adaptation mirror exposure)

TestOrder: counterbalanced testing order (ABAB // BABA)
other-self = first standard stimulus is Emma Watson, second is the participant
self-other = first standard stimulus is the participant, second is Emma Watson

pre_PSE_self = PSE value in the baseline in condition Self

pre_PSE_other = PSE value in the baseline in condition Other

post_PSE_self = PSE value in the post-test phase in condition Self

post_PSE_other = PSE value in the post-test phase in condition Other

Age = participants' age (years)

BMI = participants' BMI (rounded to 1 digit) computed from self-declared weight and height. These were not stored to ensure participants were not identifiable.

shift_self = PSE shift (post-test - baseline) in condition Self

shift_other = PSE shift (post-test - baseline) in condition Other

baseline_overestimation = PSE value in the baseline in condition Self - participants' self-declared BMI
(note that this could reflect a bias in the way the stimuli were created, not necessarily actual body shape overestimation)
